**Title: Introduction to the Internet**

### **Slide 1: What is the Internet?**
- The internet is a global network of interconnected computers.
- It allows communication, data sharing, and access to information worldwide.
- Examples of internet services: Websites, Emails, Social Media, Cloud Storage.

### **Slide 2: How Does the Internet Work?**
- **Clients and Servers:** Clients (browsers, apps) request data, and servers provide it.
- **IP Addresses & DNS:** Every device has an IP address. DNS converts domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.
- **Protocols:**
  - HTTP/HTTPS: Used for web communication.
  - TCP/IP: Ensures data is sent and received correctly.
- **Packets & Routing:** Data is broken into packets and sent across different networks.

### **Slide 3: The Role of the Internet in Websites**
- Websites are hosted on servers and accessed through browsers.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the building blocks of websites.
- Web hosting and domain names make websites accessible.

### **Slide 4: Common Internet Terms**
- **Browser:** Software to access the web (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- **URL:** Web address of a page.
- **Bandwidth:** The amount of data transferred over the internet.
- **ISP (Internet Service Provider):** Provides internet access to users.

### **Slide 5: How Do We Access Websites?**
1. A user types a website URL in a browser.
2. The browser requests the website’s data from the server.
3. The server sends the data back to the browser.
4. The browser renders the page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### **Slide 6: Importance of Internet for Web Development**
- Without the internet, websites wouldn’t be accessible worldwide.
- Web developers use the internet to:
  - Test and deploy websites.
  - Collaborate using online tools.
  - Access coding resources and communities.

### **Slide 7: Summary & Discussion**
- The internet is the backbone of modern communication and web development.
- Understanding how it works helps in learning web technologies.
- **Discussion:** What are your favorite websites, and how do you think they work?

### **What is DNS?**
- DNS stands for **Domain Name System**.
- It translates **human-readable domain names** (like `google.com`) into **IP addresses** (like `142.250.180.46`).
- It acts like the **phonebook of the internet**—instead of remembering long numbers, we use easy-to-remember domain names.

---

### **How Does DNS Work?**  
When you type a website URL in your browser, the following steps occur:

1. **User Request:**  
   - You enter `www.example.com` in a web browser.
   
2. **DNS Query:**  
   - Your computer asks the nearest **DNS resolver** (provided by your ISP) for the IP address of `www.example.com`.

3. **Recursive Lookup:**  
   - If the resolver doesn’t have the IP address cached, it contacts a series of DNS servers:
     - **Root DNS Server** → Directs to the correct **TLD (Top-Level Domain) server** (e.g., `.com`, `.org`).
     - **TLD DNS Server** → Directs to the correct **Authoritative DNS Server**.
     - **Authoritative DNS Server** → Provides the final IP address.

4. **Response to Browser:**  
   - The resolver returns the IP address to your browser.

5. **Connecting to the Website:**  
   - The browser uses the IP address to request the website content from the **web server**.

---

### **Why is DNS Important?**
- Without DNS, we would need to **memorize IP addresses** for every website.
- It helps **optimize internet speed** by caching frequently used addresses.
- It provides **security features**, such as **DNS filtering** to block malicious sites.

---

### **What is HTTP?**  
HTTP (**HyperText Transfer Protocol**) is the foundation of communication on the **World Wide Web**. It is used to transfer **web pages, images, videos, and other content** from a server to a web browser.

---

### **How Does HTTP Work?**  
1. **Client Request:**  
   - When you enter a URL (`http://example.com`), your web browser sends an **HTTP request** to the website's server.
   
2. **Server Response:**  
   - The server processes the request and sends back an **HTTP response** with the requested webpage.

3. **Rendering the Webpage:**  
   - The browser receives the data and displays the webpage.

---

### **Key Features of HTTP:**  
- **Stateless Protocol** → Each request is independent; the server doesn’t remember previous requests.  
- **Uses TCP/IP** → Ensures data is reliably transmitted.  
- **Plaintext Communication** → HTTP data is not encrypted, making it less secure.  

---

### **What is HTTPS?**  
- **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)** is the secure version of HTTP.  
- It **encrypts data** using **SSL/TLS** to protect sensitive information like passwords and payment details.  
- Websites with **HTTPS** display a **🔒 padlock** in the browser.

---
### **What is a Domain Name?**  
A **domain name** is the **human-friendly** address of a website. Instead of using an IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`), people use **domain names** like `google.com` to access websites.

---

### **How Does a Domain Name Work?**  
1. **User Types a Domain Name**  
   - Example: You enter `www.example.com` in a web browser.  

2. **DNS Resolves the Domain**  
   - The **Domain Name System (DNS)** converts `www.example.com` into an IP address.  

3. **Browser Connects to the Server**  
   - The browser uses the IP address to request the website from the server.  

4. **Website is Displayed**  
   - The web page loads in your browser.  

---

### **Types of Domain Names**  
1. **Top-Level Domains (TLDs)**  
   - `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.edu`, `.gov`  

2. **Country-Code TLDs (ccTLDs)**  
   - `.us` (United States), `.in` (India), `.uk` (United Kingdom)  

3. **Subdomains**  
   - `blog.example.com` (A section of the main website)  

---

### **Importance of a Domain Name**  
✅ Easy to remember compared to IP addresses.  
✅ Helps in branding and online presence.  
✅ Required for website hosting and emails (`yourname@example.com`).  

---

### **What are Browsers and How Do They Work?**  

A **web browser** is a software application used to access websites on the internet. Examples include **Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Opera**.  

---

### **How Do Browsers Work?**  

1. **User Enters a URL**  
   - Example: You type `www.example.com` in the address bar.  

2. **DNS Resolution**  
   - The browser contacts the **DNS (Domain Name System)** to convert the domain name into an **IP address**.  

3. **Sending an HTTP/HTTPS Request**  
   - The browser sends an **HTTP or HTTPS request** to the website's **web server**.  

4. **Receiving a Response**  
   - The **web server** processes the request and sends back a response containing **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources**.  

5. **Rendering the Web Page**  
   - The browser **parses the HTML, applies CSS styles, and executes JavaScript** to display the web page.  

---

### **Key Components of a Browser**  

🔹 **User Interface (UI)** → Address bar, navigation buttons, tabs, bookmarks.  
🔹 **Rendering Engine** → Converts HTML & CSS into a visually displayed webpage.  
🔹 **JavaScript Engine** → Runs interactive website scripts.  
🔹 **Networking** → Handles communication between the browser and servers.  
🔹 **Cache** → Stores frequently accessed files for faster loading.  

---

### **Why Are Browsers Important?**  
✅ Allow users to access the internet.  
✅ Support multimedia, interactivity, and security features.  
✅ Improve web performance through caching and optimization.

### **What is Hosting?**  

**Hosting** is a service that allows individuals and organizations to store their website files on a **server** and make them accessible on the **internet**.  

---

### **How Does Hosting Work?**  

1. **You Create a Website**  
   - The website contains HTML, CSS, images, videos, and other files.  

2. **Files are Uploaded to a Hosting Server**  
   - A web hosting provider stores your website on a **server** (a powerful computer that runs 24/7).  

3. **Users Access Your Website via a Domain Name**  
   - When someone enters your domain (e.g., `www.example.com`), the browser sends a request to the **hosting server**.  

4. **Server Sends the Website to the User’s Browser**  
   - The hosting server processes the request and delivers the website files to the user’s browser.  

---

### **Types of Hosting**  

🔹 **Shared Hosting** → Multiple websites share a single server (budget-friendly, but limited resources).  
🔹 **VPS (Virtual Private Server) Hosting** → A virtualized server with dedicated resources.  
🔹 **Dedicated Hosting** → An entire physical server for one website (high performance).  
🔹 **Cloud Hosting** → Uses multiple servers for better scalability and uptime.  
🔹 **WordPress Hosting** → Optimized for WordPress sites with pre-configured settings.  

---

### **Why is Hosting Important?**  
✅ Makes your website accessible worldwide.  
✅ Provides **storage, security, and performance** for your website.  
✅ Enables **email hosting, databases, and backups**.

The **basic structure of an HTML document** looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML!</h1>
    <p>This is a basic HTML structure.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` → Defines the document type as HTML5.
- `<html>` → The root element of the HTML page.
- `<head>` → Contains metadata (title, links, scripts, etc.).
- `<title>` → The title displayed on the browser tab.
- `<body>` → Contains the content visible on the webpage.
- `<h1>` → Heading tag.
- `<p>` → Paragraph tag.

### **HTML Elements, Tags, and Attributes**  

#### **1. HTML Elements**  
An **element** consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.  
Example:  
```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
- `<p>` → Opening tag  
- `This is a paragraph.` → Content  
- `</p>` → Closing tag  

#### **2. HTML Tags**  
A **tag** is used to define an element.  
Types of tags:  
- **Paired Tags** (Opening & Closing) → `<h1>...</h1>`, `<p>...</p>`  
- **Self-Closing Tags** → `<br>`, `<img>`, `<input>`  

#### **3. HTML Attributes**  
Attributes provide **additional information** about an element.  
Example:  
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample Image" width="200">
```
- `src="image.jpg"` → Specifies image source  
- `alt="Sample Image"` → Alternate text  
- `width="200"` → Defines image width  

### **Important HTML Tags**  

Here are some essential HTML tags:  

#### **1. Basic Structure Tags**
- `<html>` → Defines the HTML document  
- `<head>` → Contains metadata  
- `<title>` → Sets the page title  
- `<body>` → Contains the visible content  

#### **2. Text Formatting Tags**
- `<h1>` to `<h6>` → Headings (largest to smallest)  
- `<p>` → Paragraph  
- `<b>` → Bold text  
- `<i>` → Italic text  
- `<u>` → Underlined text  
- `<br>` → Line break  
- `<hr>` → Horizontal line  

#### **3. List Tags**
- `<ul>` → Unordered list  
- `<ol>` → Ordered list  
- `<li>` → List item  

#### **4. Table Tags**
- `<table>` → Creates a table  
- `<tr>` → Table row  
- `<th>` → Table header  
- `<td>` → Table data  

#### **5. Form Tags**
- `<form>` → Creates a form  
- `<input>` → Input field  
- `<textarea>` → Text area  
- `<button>` → Button  
- `<label>` → Labels for inputs  

#### **6. Media Tags**
- `<img>` → Displays an image  
- `<audio>` → Embeds audio  
- `<video>` → Embeds video  

In **HTML**, there are no explicit "conditional" or "unconditional" tags, but the concept can be interpreted as follows:

### **1. Conditional Tags (or Conditional Comments)**
Conditional comments were primarily used in older versions of **Internet Explorer (IE)** to apply different styles or scripts for specific versions of the browser.

Example:
```html
<!--[if IE]>
    <p>You are using Internet Explorer.</p>
<![endif]-->
```
This would only be rendered in **Internet Explorer**.

Since modern browsers no longer support conditional comments, **CSS media queries and JavaScript feature detection** (e.g., using `navigator.userAgent` or Modernizr) are preferred alternatives.

---

### **2. Unconditional Tags**
Unconditional tags are standard **HTML elements** that are always processed by the browser, regardless of conditions.

Example:
```html
<p>This is always visible.</p>
```
Unlike conditional comments, this paragraph will be displayed on all browsers without any conditions.

---

### **Modern Alternative to Conditional Comments**
Since conditional comments are deprecated, use **CSS Media Queries** or **JavaScript** instead.

#### **Using CSS Media Queries**
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
        background-color: lightblue;
    }
}
```
This will apply a blue background **only if the screen width is 600px or less**.

#### **Using JavaScript**
```javascript
if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Chrome") !== -1) {
    console.log("You are using Chrome.");
}
```
This script detects if the user is on Chrome.



Here’s an explanation of the elements in the table along with simple HTML examples:

---

### 1️⃣ **Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)**
Headings are used to define titles in an HTML document.

#### Example:
```html
<h1>Main Heading (h1)</h1>
<h2>Subheading (h2)</h2>
<h3>Section Title (h3)</h3>
```

📌 **`h1` is the largest heading** and **`h6` is the smallest**.

---

### 2️⃣ **Paragraphs (`<p>`)**
The `<p>` tag is used for writing paragraphs in HTML.

#### Example:
```html
<p>This is a paragraph. It contains text and wraps automatically.</p>
```

---

### 3️⃣ **Fonts (`<font>` and CSS Styling)**
The `<font>` tag was used in older HTML versions but is now replaced by CSS.

#### Example (Using CSS):
```html
<p style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 20px;">This is a styled paragraph.</p>
```

---

### 4️⃣ **Images (`<img>`)**
The `<img>` tag is used to display images.

#### Example:
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of Image" width="300">
```
📌 `alt` provides alternative text in case the image doesn’t load.

---

### 5️⃣ **Marquee (`<marquee>`)**
The `<marquee>` tag is used for scrolling text or images. However, it is outdated and not recommended.

#### Example:
```html
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left">This is scrolling text!</marquee>
```

---

### 📌 **HTML Tables**
In HTML, the `<table>` tag is used to create tables. It consists of rows (`<tr>`), columns (`<td>` for data cells), and headers (`<th>`).

---

### ✅ **Basic Table Example**
```html
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
        <th>City</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Alice</td>
        <td>25</td>
        <td>New York</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Bob</td>
        <td>30</td>
        <td>Los Angeles</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```
**📝 Explanation:**
- `<table>`: Defines a table.
- `<tr>`: Creates a new row.
- `<th>`: Defines a **header** (bold & centered by default).
- `<td>`: Defines a **table cell** (data entry).
- `border="1"`: Adds a border to the table.

    The content in the image appears to be part of an **HTML table layout**. Below is an explanation and a small HTML example based on the topics in your image:

---
---

### **2. Difference between HTML5 and HTML**
| Feature            | HTML4 | HTML5 |
|--------------------|-------|-------|
| **Doctype** | `<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">` | `<!DOCTYPE html>` |
| **Multimedia Support** | Needs Flash/JavaScript for media | Built-in `<audio>` & `<video>` |
| **Semantic Elements** | Uses `<div>` for layout | Introduces `<header>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, etc. |
| **Form Elements** | Limited input types | New input types (`email`, `date`, `search`, etc.) |

---

### **1. HTML5 Tags**
HTML5 introduced new **semantic** and **functional** tags to improve web structure and multimedia handling.

**Example:**
```html
<header>Header Content</header>
<section>Main Section</section>
<article>Article Content</article>
<footer>Footer Content</footer>
```

---

### **2. Header, Footer, Sections, and Articles**
These **semantic elements** provide a meaningful structure to the webpage.

| **Tag**       | **Purpose** |
|--------------|------------|
| `<header>`   | Represents the top section (logo, navigation) |
| `<footer>`   | Contains copyright, contact info, etc. |
| `<section>`  | Groups related content |
| `<article>`  | Represents independent content (blog posts, news) |

**Example:**
```html
<header>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
</header>
<section>
    <article>
        <h2>Article Title</h2>
        <p>This is an article inside a section.</p>
    </article>
</section>
<footer>
    <p>&copy; 2025 My Website</p>
</footer>
```

---

### **3. Canvas**
The `<canvas>` tag is used for drawing graphics (shapes, charts, images) using JavaScript.

**Example:**
```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100" style="border:1px solid black;"></canvas>
<script>
    var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
    var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
    ctx.fillStyle = "blue";
    ctx.fillRect(50, 20, 100, 50);
</script>
```

---

### **4. Audio, Video, Meta, Validation**
- **Audio & Video:** HTML5 supports embedding media without plugins.
- **Meta Tags:** Provide metadata (character set, viewport settings).
- **Form Validation:** Uses built-in attributes like `required` and `pattern`.

**Example:**
```html
<audio controls>
    <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support audio.
</audio>

<video width="320" height="240" controls>
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>

<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

<form>
    <label>Email: <input type="email" required></label>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

---

### **5. HTML Layout Structure Using HTML5 Tags**
A basic **HTML5 layout** using the new semantic tags.

**Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML5 Layout</title>
</head>
<body>

    <header>
        <h1>My Website</h1>
    </header>

    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

    <section>
        <article>
            <h2>Article Heading</h2>
            <p>Content of the article goes here.</p>
        </article>
    </section>

    <aside>
        <p>Sidebar content (ads, links, etc.)</p>
    </aside>

    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2025 My Website</p>
    </footer>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation and Small HTML Examples for the Topics in Your Image

---

### **1. Difference between HTML and HTML5**
HTML5 is an improved version of HTML with new **semantic elements, multimedia support, and better performance**.

| Feature | HTML | HTML5 |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Doctype** | `<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ...>` | `<!DOCTYPE html>` |
| **Multimedia** | Needs Flash for video/audio | `<audio>` and `<video>` supported natively |
| **Semantic Tags** | Uses `<div>` for everything | New elements like `<article>`, `<section>` |
| **Forms** | Limited input types | New input types (`email`, `date`, `range`) |
| **Graphics** | Uses external plugins | `<canvas>` and `<svg>` supported |

**Example (HTML5 Multimedia Support):**
```html
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

---

### **2. Semantic HTML**
Semantic HTML makes web pages more **meaningful and accessible** by using **descriptive elements**.

| Semantic Tag | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `<header>` | Defines a header for a document or section |
| `<nav>` | Represents navigation links |
| `<article>` | Represents an independent piece of content |
| `<section>` | Defines a thematic grouping of content |
| `<footer>` | Represents the footer of a document or section |

**Example:**
```html
<header>
    <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
</header>
<section>
    <article>
        <h2>Article Title</h2>
        <p>This is a sample article using semantic HTML.</p>
    </article>
</section>
<footer>
    <p>Copyright © 2025</p>
</footer>
```

---

### **3. Forms and Validation**
HTML5 introduced **new input types** and **built-in form validation**.

**Example of an HTML5 form with validation:**
```html
<form>
    <label>Email: <input type="email" required></label>
    <label>Password: <input type="password" required minlength="6"></label>
    <label>Birthdate: <input type="date"></label>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```
- `required` → Ensures field is filled before submission.
- `type="email"` → Validates correct email format.
- `minlength="6"` → Ensures password is at least 6 characters.

---

### **4. Working with Conventions and HTML Skeleton (Meta Tag)**
The **HTML skeleton** includes essential metadata inside the `<head>` section.

**Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta name="description" content="Learn HTML5 essentials">
    <title>HTML5 Basics</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">` → Supports special characters.
- `<meta name="viewport">` → Ensures responsiveness on mobile devices.
- `<meta name="description">` → Improves SEO.

---

### **5. Accessibility**
**Accessibility (A11Y)** makes websites usable for people with disabilities.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `alt` | Describes images for screen readers |
| `aria-label` | Provides labels for elements |
| `tabindex` | Controls keyboard navigation order |

**Example:**
```html
<img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
<button aria-label="Close Menu">X</button>
<a href="#" tabindex="1">Go to Homepage</a>
```
