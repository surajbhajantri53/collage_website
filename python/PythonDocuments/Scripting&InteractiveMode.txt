**Scripting Mode and Interactive Mode in Python**

Python provides two primary ways to execute code: **Interactive Mode** and **Scripting Mode**. Understanding both is essential for efficient coding and debugging.

---
## **1. Interactive Mode**

### **What is Interactive Mode?**
Interactive Mode (also known as the Python REPL - Read-Eval-Print Loop) allows users to execute Python commands one at a time and see immediate results. It is useful for testing small code snippets and debugging.

### **How to Use Interactive Mode?**
To open the interactive mode, simply open the terminal or command prompt and type:
```sh
python
```
Or, for Python 3:
```sh
python3
```

### **Example in Interactive Mode:**
```python
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
>>> 5 + 3
8
>>> x = 10
>>> x * 2
20
```

### **Advantages of Interactive Mode:**
‚úÖ **Instant feedback** ‚Äì Results appear immediately.  
‚úÖ **Easy debugging** ‚Äì Test small code snippets quickly.  
‚úÖ **No need for a script file** ‚Äì Execute commands directly.  

### **Disadvantages of Interactive Mode:**
‚ùå **Not suitable for large programs** ‚Äì You cannot save and run an entire project.  
‚ùå **Cannot reuse code easily** ‚Äì Commands are lost after closing the session.

## **2. Scripting Mode**

### **What is Scripting Mode?**
Scripting Mode is used to write Python programs in a file with a **.py** extension and execute them as a script. This mode is ideal for writing reusable and large-scale programs.

### **How to Use Scripting Mode?**
1. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, PyCharm).
2. Write your Python code and save the file with a **.py** extension (e.g., `script.py`).
3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the file location.
4. Run the script using:
```sh
python script.py
```
Or for Python 3:
```sh
python3 script.py
```

### **Example in Scripting Mode (script.py):**
```python
# This is a simple Python script
name = "Alice"
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```
#### **Output when executed:**
```
Hello, Alice!
```

### **Advantages of Scripting Mode:**
‚úÖ **Best for large programs** ‚Äì Ideal for writing full-fledged applications.  
‚úÖ **Code reusability** ‚Äì Scripts can be saved and reused.  
‚úÖ **Can include complex logic** ‚Äì Supports loops, functions, and file handling.  

### **Disadvantages of Scripting Mode:**
‚ùå **No immediate feedback** ‚Äì Unlike interactive mode, you must run the script to see results.  
‚ùå **Requires a text editor** ‚Äì You must write and save code in a file before execution.

## **3. Key Differences Between Interactive and Scripting Mode**

| Feature               | Interactive Mode | Scripting Mode |
|----------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Execution Type**   | Line-by-line execution | Full script execution |
| **Usage**            | Small code snippets | Large programs |
| **Persistence**      | Commands lost after closing session | Code is saved in a file |
| **Best For**         | Testing & debugging | Full-scale development |
| **Ease of Use**      | Simple & quick | Requires saving and running a file |

## **4. When to Use Which Mode?**
- **Use Interactive Mode** when testing small pieces of code, learning Python, or debugging simple commands.
- **Use Scripting Mode** when building applications, working on projects, or writing complex logic.
