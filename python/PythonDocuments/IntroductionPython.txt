**Introduction to Python Programming**

## **1. Introduction to Python**
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in 1991. Python is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.

### **Key Features of Python:**
- **Easy to Learn & Use** – Simple syntax, similar to English.
- **Interpreted Language** – No need for compilation; executed line by line.
- **Dynamically Typed** – No need to define variable types.
- **Extensive Libraries** – Includes NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and more.
- **Platform Independent** – Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Object-Oriented & Functional** – Supports multiple programming paradigms.

## **2. Advantages & Disadvantages of Python**

### **Advantages:**
✅ **Readable and Simple Syntax** – Code is easy to understand and write.  
✅ **Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Runs on multiple operating systems.  
✅ **Large Community Support** – Extensive documentation and open-source contributions.  
✅ **Rich Standard Library** – Prebuilt modules for various tasks.  
✅ **Versatile Applications** – Used in web development, AI, machine learning, automation, etc.  

### **Disadvantages:**
❌ **Slower Execution Speed** – Due to interpretation rather than compilation.  
❌ **Higher Memory Usage** – Not suitable for memory-constrained applications.  
❌ **Weak in Mobile Development** – Less used for mobile apps compared to Java/Kotlin.  
❌ **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** – Limits multi-threading capabilities.
