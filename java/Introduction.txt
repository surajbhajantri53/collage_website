## ðŸ“˜ Introduction to Java

 What is Java?

Java is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language** developed by **Sun Microsystems** (now owned by Oracle) in **1995**. It is designed to be **simple**, **secure**, and **platform-independent**, meaning you can write code once and run it anywhere (thanks to the **Java Virtual Machine - JVM**).

---

Key Features of Java:

1. **Platform Independent**: Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA).
2. **Object-Oriented**: Everything in Java is treated as an object.
3. **Simple & Secure**: Easy to learn with a strong security model.
4. **Robust & Reliable**: Manages memory automatically (Garbage Collection).
5. **Multithreaded**: Can handle multiple tasks at once.
6. **Portable**: Java programs can be moved easily from one system to another.

Why Learn Java?

* Used in **web applications**, **Android apps**, **enterprise systems**, and more.
* Powerful community support and large number of job opportunities.
* Solid foundation for understanding other programming languages.

---

Java is Used In:

* Android App Development
* Web Applications
* Game Development
* Cloud-based Applications
* Internet of Things (IoT)

Here is a clean and simple note for **Java History** that students can easily understand:

---

## Java History

Java was developed by **James Gosling** and his team at **Sun Microsystems** in the early 1990s. The project was initially called **"Oak"**, named after an oak tree that stood outside Goslingâ€™s office.

However, the name "Oak" was already in use by another company, so it was later changed to **Java**, inspired by Java coffee from Indonesia.

### Important Milestones:

* **1991**: Project started by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton.
* **1995**: Java 1.0 was officially released by Sun Microsystems.
* **2006**: Sun made Java open-source and released it under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
* **2010**: Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems and took over Java development.

### Purpose Behind Java:

* Initially designed for **embedded systems** and set-top boxes.
* Later became widely used for **internet applications** due to its platform independence.

### Why Java Was a Breakthrough:

* Platform-independent code using the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.
* Provided **network and security features** that were ideal for internet-based programs.

## Why Java

Java is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. It is chosen by developers for its reliability, security, and platform independence.

### Reasons to Use Java:

1. **Platform Independent**
   Java programs run on any operating system using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This allows developers to write code once and run it anywhere.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming**
   Java is built on object-oriented principles, making code reusable, modular, and easier to maintain.

3. **Simple and Easy to Learn**
   Java has a clean syntax and removes many complex features from earlier languages like C++ (such as pointers and multiple inheritance).

4. **Secure**
   Java provides strong memory management, built-in security features, and runs in a controlled environment called the sandbox.

5. **Robust and Reliable**
   Java has strong type-checking, exception handling, and garbage collection, making it less prone to crashes.

6. **Multithreaded**
   Java supports multithreading, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously, which improves performance.

7. **Rich API and Libraries**
   Java provides a large set of built-in libraries for data structures, networking, file handling, GUI development, etc.

8. **Community Support and Documentation**
   Java has strong community support, plenty of learning resources, and frequent updates.

Here are the notes for **Environmental Setup** for Java:

---

## Environmental Setup

Before writing and running Java programs, you need to set up the Java environment on your system.

### Step 1: Install Java Development Kit (JDK)

1. Visit the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. Download the latest version of **JDK** suitable for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

After installing JDK, you need to configure the system to recognize Java commands.

#### For Windows:

1. Open **Control Panel â†’ System â†’ Advanced system settings**.
2. Click on **Environment Variables**.
3. Under **System Variables**, click **New**:

   * Variable name: `JAVA_HOME`
   * Variable value: Path where JDK is installed (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21`)
4. Find the `Path` variable, click **Edit**, and add:

   ```
   %JAVA_HOME%\bin
   ```

#### For macOS/Linux:

Add the following lines to `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc`:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-21.jdk/Contents/Home
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

Then run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

Open a terminal (or Command Prompt) and type:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

If both commands show version numbers, Java is installed and configured successfully.

### Step 4: Install an IDE (Optional)

You can use any text editor to write Java code, but using an IDE makes development easier.

Popular IDEs for Java:

* **Eclipse**
* **IntelliJ IDEA**
* **NetBeans**

Here are the notes for **JDK, JRE, JVM**:

## JDK, JRE, JVM

These three components are essential parts of the Java programming environment. Understanding the difference between them is important for Java developers.

---

### 1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

* **Definition**: JVM is the engine that runs Java bytecode.
* **Role**: It converts bytecode (.class files) into machine code and executes it.
* **Platform-Dependent**: JVM is platform-specific because each operating system has its own JVM implementation.
* **Key Responsibilities**:

  * Loads class files
  * Verifies bytecode
  * Executes code
  * Manages memory and garbage collection

---

### 2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

* **Definition**: JRE provides the environment required to run Java applications.
* **Components**:

  * JVM
  * Set of libraries and class files
* **Use Case**: It is used **only for running** Java programs, not for developing them.
* **Does not include** tools like `javac` (compiler).

---

### 3. JDK (Java Development Kit)

* **Definition**: JDK is a full software development kit used to **develop and run** Java programs.
* **Components**:

  * JRE (which includes JVM)
  * Development tools like compiler (`javac`), debugger, etc.
* **Use Case**: Required for Java development.

### Summary Table:

| Component | Contains        | Used For        | Includes      |
| --------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| JVM       | -               | Running code    | -             |
| JRE       | JVM + Libraries | Running code    | JVM           |
| JDK       | JRE + Dev tools | Developing code | JRE (and JVM) |
