## Data Types, Variables and Constants

Understanding data types, variables, and constants is fundamental in Java programming.

### 1. Data Types

Data types specify the type of data a variable can hold.

#### Java has two main categories of data types:

**a. Primitive Data Types**
These are the basic data types built into Java.

| Data Type | Size    | Description                      | Example              |
| --------- | ------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| byte      | 1 byte  | Whole numbers from -128 to 127   | byte b = 10;         |
| short     | 2 bytes | Whole numbers from -32K to 32K   | short s = 1000;      |
| int       | 4 bytes | Most common integer type         | int a = 5000;        |
| long      | 8 bytes | Larger integers                  | long l = 123456789L; |
| float     | 4 bytes | Decimal numbers (less precision) | float f = 10.5f;     |
| double    | 8 bytes | Decimal numbers (more precision) | double d = 99.99;    |
| char      | 2 bytes | Single character                 | char c = 'A';        |
| boolean   | 1 bit   | true or false                    | boolean flag = true; |

**b. Non-Primitive Data Types**
These include classes, arrays, interfaces, and strings.

### 2. Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

**Declaration Syntax**:

```java
type variableName = value;
```

**Example**:

```java
int age = 25;
String name = "John";
```

**Types of Variables**:

* **Local Variable**: Declared inside a method.
* **Instance Variable**: Declared inside a class but outside methods.
* **Static Variable**: Declared with the `static` keyword and shared among all objects.

### 3. Constants

Constants are variables whose value cannot be changed once assigned.

**Declared using `final` keyword**:

```java
final int MAX_AGE = 100;
```

Attempting to change `MAX_AGE` later in the code will result in a compilation error.
